# AI Agent Instructions for Godot Dyslexia Learning Game

**COPILOT INSTRUCTION**:

- use context7 MCP only when it is necessary, such as when prompts mention - GodotFirebase, Google Cloud, Firebase, docs, API
- Use GITHUB MCP for analyzing my godot repository
- Use markitdown MCP for converting documents to .md
- you dont have to test since godot isn't in the PATH, I will do the test in godot platform
- DO NOT USE EMOJI AS DYSLEXIA FONT DOES NOT SUPPORT IT WHEN EXPORTED TO WEB
- Always use tab indentation, never spaces
- Firebase operations always use await pattern
- YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT .MD UNLESS IT'S NECESSARY AS IT WASTE COPILOT CREDITS
- UI transitions use fade-in/fade-out patterns
- ACT LIKE A GODOT GAME DEVELOPER WITH EXPERIENCE
- DON'T STOP UNTIL YOU ABLE TO EXECUTE THE OBJECTIVE BASE ON MY PROMPT, ALWAYS THINK AHEAD
- If you will edit my index.html, you can only edit the head tag as you cannot edit the body as godot reset/override it when exported
- I can manually export the web so you dont have to test it via terminal
